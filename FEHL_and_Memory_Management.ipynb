        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - The main difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how they execute code.\n",
        " - Compiled Languages:\n",
        "    - Process: Code is translated into machine language (binary) before execution.\n",
        "    - Speed: Faster execution since it runs directly as machine code.\n",
        "    - Error Detection: Errors are found at compile time.\n",
        "    - Examples: C, C++, Rust, Go.\n",
        " - Interpreted Languages:\n",
        "    - Process: Code is executed line-by-line at runtime by an interpreter.\n",
        "    - Speed: Slower than compiled languages since translation happens during execution.\n",
        "    - Error Detection: Errors appear during runtime.\n",
        "    - Examples: Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.\n",
        " - Hybrid Approach (Both Interpreted & Compiled)\n",
        "    - Java: Compiles to bytecode (intermediate code), which is then interpreted by the JVM.\n",
        "    - Python: Often compiled to bytecode (.pyc) and then interpreted.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " - Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during program execution, preventing crashes and allowing graceful recovery.\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The finally block in Python is used to define code that will always execute, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not. It ensures that important cleanup actions (like closing files, releasing resources, or disconnecting from a database) are performed.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Logging in Python is a way to track events that happen while a program runs. It helps with debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting by recording messages about the program’s execution.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " - The __del__ method (also called the destructor) is a special method in Python that is called when an object is about to be destroyed. It is mainly used for cleanup operations like closing files, releasing memory, or disconnecting from databases.\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, both import and from ... import are used to bring modules or specific parts of modules into your code, but they differ in how they do this and what they bring into the namespace.\n",
        "    -  import Statement:\n",
        "    - Syntax: import module_name\n",
        "    - Usage: This imports the entire module into your current namespace.\n",
        "    - Access: To access functions, classes, or variables from the module, you need to use the module name as a prefix.\n",
        "    - from ... import Statement:\n",
        "    - Syntax: from module_name import name1, name2, ...\n",
        "    - Usage: This imports specific functions, classes, or variables from a module directly into your current namespace.\n",
        "    - Access: You can use the imported names directly without the module prefix.\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using a single try block followed by multiple except blocks. This allows you to catch and handle different types of exceptions separately.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " - The with statement in Python is used for handling files efficiently and safely. Its main purpose is to ensure that resources, such as file handles, are properly managed, avoiding potential issues like memory leaks or unclosed files.\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " - Both multithreading and multiprocessing allow parallel execution, but they differ in how they utilize system resources and handle concurrency.\n",
        "\n",
        " - 1. Multithreading:\n",
        "    - Running multiple threads (lightweight processes) within the same process\n",
        "    - Used For: I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file operations, network requests, database queries)\n",
        " - How It Works:\n",
        "    - Threads share the same memory space.\n",
        "    - Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.\n",
        "    - This limits true parallel execution for CPU-bound tasks but works well for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        " - 2. Multiprocessing\n",
        "    - Running multiple processes, each with its own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
        "    - Used For: CPU-bound tasks (e.g., data processing, complex calculations).\n",
        "    - How It Works:\n",
        "    - Each process runs independently and does not share memory.\n",
        "    - The GIL is bypassed, allowing true parallel execution across multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " - Advantages of Using Logging in a Program:\n",
        "Logging is essential for tracking application behavior, debugging, and maintaining software. Here are the key benefits of using logging in a program:\n",

        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in Python refers to the process of allocating, using, and freeing memory efficiently during program execution. Python handles memory management automatically using a combination of reference counting, garbage collection, and memory pools.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Basic Steps in Exception Handling in Python:\n",
        "  Exception handling in Python is done using the try-except block to catch and manage errors during program execution, preventing crashes.\n",
        "     - 1. Try Block (try):\n",
        "     - 2. Catch the Exception (except):\n",
        "     - 3. Execute Alternative Code (else):\n",
        "     - 4. Cleanup (finally):\n",
        "     - 5. Raising Exceptions (raise):\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python is crucial for ensuring efficient resource utilization, preventing memory leaks, and improving program performance. Since Python automatically manages memory, understanding its importance helps developers write optimized and scalable applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - Role of try and except in Exception Handling in Python:\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is done using the try and except blocks. These help in managing runtime errors and preventing program crashes.\n",
        "    - 1. try Block: Detects Errors:\n",
        "    - 2. except Block: Handles Errors:\n",
        "    - 3. Handling Any Exception (except Exception as e):\n",
        "    - 4. Using else with try-except:\n",
        "    - 5. Using finally for Cleanup:\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Python's garbage collection (GC) system automatically manages memory by removing unused objects, preventing memory leaks, and optimizing performance. It primarily works through reference counting and cyclic garbage collection.\n",
        "     - 1. Reference Counting:\n",
        "     - 2. Garbage Collection for Cyclic References:\n",
        "     - 3. Generational Garbage Collection:\n",
        "     - 4. Manually Controlling Garbage Collection:\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The else block in exception handling is used to execute code only if no exception occurs in the try block. This helps separate error-handling logic from the main logic of the program.\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - Python’s logging module provides different levels of logging to categorize messages based on severity. These levels help developers debug, monitor, and troubleshoot applications efficiently.\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " - Both os.fork() and the multiprocessing module are used to create new processes in Python, but they work differently and are suited for different use cases.\n",
        " - 1. os.fork():\n",
        "     - os.fork() is a low-level system call available only on Unix/Linux (not on Windows).\n",
        "     - It creates a child process by duplicating the parent process.\n",
        "     - The child process has a separate memory space but starts execution from the same point as the parent.\n",
        " - 2. multiprocessing Module:\n",
        "     - multiprocessing is a higher-level module that works on both Windows and Unix.\n",
        "     - It creates separate processes and allows easy communication between them.\n",
        "     - Each process has its own memory space (no shared memory by default).\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        "  - When working with files in Python, it's crucial to close them properly after use. Failing to do so can lead to resource leaks, data corruption, or unexpected behavior.\n",
